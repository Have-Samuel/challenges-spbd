# 1. Logical Colors
In the problem, we'll test your understanding of basic conditional logic.

We'll give you twovariables with boolean value- x & y.

Create a program with the followig logic:
- if x is true, return the string "Red".
- if y is false. return the string "Yellow".
- if x is true and y a is false, return the string "Blue".
- Otherwise, return the string "Purple".

# max
write a function max, which accepts an array and returns the highest value. Do not use the built-in Math() function!

# removeNumbers
In this problem, you'll be given a string that is a combination of letters and numbers. Return a new String that has all of the numbers removed, and only contains letters and spaces

For instance, if you have the string; 'IW4nt 2 Br3ak Free' return the string 'Wnt Brak Fr'.

# onlyEvens
In this problem, you'll be given an array of integers. Return a new array that contains only the even numbers in the original array.

For instance, if you are given the array [1,2,3,4,5], return a new array with the values[2,3].

# contauinsEveryVowel
In this problem, you'll be given a string, if it contains every vowel, excluding y, return true. if it does not contain every vowel, return false, For the purpose of this problem, al letters will be lowercase, so do not worry about checking for uppercase vowels.

For instance, if the string is: 'gaint sequoia', return true. if the string is: 'hello world', return false.

# VowelFrequency
In this problem, you'll iterate over an input string and return String with the count of the frequency of the different vowels in the string. The vowels in the return String be in the order they appear in the input String. For the purposes of the problem, all letters in the input String will be lowercase.
For instance, 'hello world' should return 'elo2'. 'we are the champions' should return 'e3a2i1o1', 'plz 7 thx' should return an empty string.
