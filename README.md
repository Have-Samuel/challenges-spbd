# 1. Logical Colors
In the problem, we'll test your understanding of basic conditional logic.

We'll give you twovariables with boolean value- x & y.

Create a program with the followig logic:
- if x is true, return the string "Red".
- if y is false. return the string "Yellow".
- if x is true and y a is false, return the string "Blue".
- Otherwise, return the string "Purple".

# max
write a function max, which accepts an array and returns the highest value. Do not use the built-in Math() function!
