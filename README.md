# 1. Logical Colors
In the problem, we'll test your understanding of basic conditional logic.

We'll give you twovariables with boolean value- x & y.

Create a program with the followig logic:
- if x is true, return the string "Red".
- if y is false. return the string "Yellow".
- if x is true and y a is false, return the string "Blue".
- Otherwise, return the string "Purple".

# max
write a function max, which accepts an array and returns the highest value. Do not use the built-in Math() function!

# removeNumbers
In this problem, you'll be given a string that is a combination of letters and numbers. Return a new String that has all of the numbers removed, and only contains letters and spaces

For instance, if you have the string; 'IW4nt 2 Br3ak Free' return the string 'Wnt Brak Fr'.

# onlyEvens
In this problem, you'll be given an array of integers. Return a new array that contains only the even numbers in the original array.

For instance, if you are given the array [1,2,3,4,5], return a new array with the values[2,3].
